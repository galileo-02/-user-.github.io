    * Play, pause, and skip tracks.
    * [*If applicable, add details about volume control, progress bar, etc.*]

    * Includes video playback with standard controls (play/pause, skip).
    * [*If applicable, add details about fullscreen mode, etc.*]

## Installation

Getting *Timve* up and running on your local machine is straightforward. Since it's a front-end project, you generally just need a web browser!

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
* (Optional, but recommended for development) A local web server to prevent CORS issues, such as Live Server for VS Code, or Python's simple HTTP server.

### Setup

1.  *Clone the repository:*

    bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Timve.git](https://github.com/your-username/Timve.git)
    

    (Important:* Replace your-username/Timve.git with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)*
2.  *Navigate into the project directory:*

    bash
    cd Timve
    
3.  *Open in your browser:*

    Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the index.html file, or if you're using a local server, navigate to its address (e.g., http://localhost:5500/index.html).

## Usage

Once you've opened *Timve* in your browser, you can start enjoying the music and videos!

* *Navigation:* Use the navigation links (if any) to explore different sections like "Home," "Genres," or "Playlists."
* *Audio Playback:* Click on any song or album cover to start playing music. Use the on-screen controls (play/pause, next, previous, volume) to manage playback.
